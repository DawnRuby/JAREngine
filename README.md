# JAREngine
This is JAREngine (Jet another Rust Engine). The idea is to help with certain calls in Vulkan Libraries and build this out for functional game development via various features.
The intention is to have a minimal, cross platform functional game engine that allows developers to not think about the complexities of Vulkan calls and simplify a lot of their functionality.
